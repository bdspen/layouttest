# layouttest
The layout test for Epicodus

This page was intended to be an exact replica of the page shown in the image on the application here:https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/layout-test
In this version I wrote all the code myself.

The page can be seen here:http://bdspen.github.io/layouttest/


For the next two examples I used bootstrap to creat the pages.
Those can be seen here: http://bdspen.github.io/layout_test_bootstrap/

and here: http://bdspen.github.io/layouttestbootstrap
